# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

How do I make a good changelog. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Guiding Principles

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- Versions and sections should be linkable.
- The latest version comes first.
- The release date of each version is displayed.
- Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Types of changes
-	Added for new features.
-	Changed for changes in existing functionality.
-	Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features.
-	Removed for now removed features.
-	Fixed for any bug fixes.
-	Security in case of vulnerabilities.
